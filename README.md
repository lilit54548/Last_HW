# Network Analysis and Graph Theory

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is focused on network analysis and graph theory, utilizing the Python library NetworkX. It provides a series of analyses and visualizations related to network structures and properties.

## Contents
1. **Importing Libraries:** The notebook begins with the importation of necessary libraries, such as `networkx` for network analysis and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting. It also includes a setup for a community detection algorithm.

2. **Sectioned Analysis:** The notebook is organized into numbered sections, each focusing on different aspects or tasks of network analysis. Key tasks include:
   - Initializing and analyzing directed and undirected graphs
   - Identifying key network properties like bridges in graphs
   - Additional network analysis tasks (not fully detailed here)

## Usage
To use this notebook, one should have a basic understanding of Python and network analysis concepts. The notebook can be run in a Jupyter environment, and each cell should be executed in sequence for proper functionality. Ensure that all necessary libraries and data files (like `connections.txt`) are available in your environment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX library
- Matplotlib library
- Jupyter Notebook environment
